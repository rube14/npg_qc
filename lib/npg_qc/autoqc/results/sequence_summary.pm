=head1 NAME

npg_qc::autoqc::results::sequence_summary

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A class for wrapping information about a sequence such as
a header, md5, etc.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 sequence_file

Attribute, a path of bam/cram input file.

=head2 sequence_format

Attribute, sequence format (bam|cram) derived from the sequence file extension.

=head2 header

Attribute, header of the bam/cram sequence file, @SQ lines filtered out.
To be compatible with JSON format, this string is UTF8-encoded.

=head2 md5

Attribute, md5 of the sequence file.

=head2 seqchksum

Attribute, seqchksum of the sequence file.

=head2 seqchksum_sha512

Attribute, seqchksum_sha512 of the sequence file.

=head2 execute

Method forcing all lazy attributes of the object to be built.
